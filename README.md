## Detailed description
- This application lets anyone who plays our game challenge themselves by answering the random questions which need a lot of knowledge.The random questions will be divided into 4 levels, starting from beginner, and the level will be increased if you answer it correctly. You will have an option to choose to answer or not. If you choose the correct answer, you will go to the next question but if you choose the wrong answer, the game will deduct your money. Therefore, we have another option which is not answer and it will make you skip to another question. Each question will have 4 choices.
